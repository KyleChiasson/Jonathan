      if adding microtransactions to our video game products would be worth it. John
      (thought): I don\u2019t know what\u2019s worse, the fact that I don\u2019t
      know much about microtransactions, or the fact that I didn\u2019t know we even
      had video game products\u2026 "
  choices:
  - What would be the impact of microtransactions?
  - We have games?
